Static Rates: 
MLOS & Stopsells: Please note all properties are subject to dynamic yielding, meaning our Revenue and Distribution team 
may apply minimum length of stay or stop-sell contracted rates, dependent on occupancy and demand.  
Packaging: You may only re-sell these contracted rates as part of a package, this is imperative to ensure your contracted 
rates remain opaque and not exposed to the market.  
Example: you cannot sell 1 night at Discovery Rottnest Island, without packaging it up with ferry and/or day touring 
components.  
Dynamic Rates: 
The G’day Group is also able to offer ad-hoc dynamic rates for the non-contracted properties. Should you receive an 
enquiry from your clients, please reach out to us and we will assess the request accordingly. All requests are assessed 
based on occupancy and demand for the period, with a rate determined by our Revenue Team.  
Experiences – Activities, Food and Beverages: 
Unless included in the accommodation rates, all activities and F&B offerings are capped at 10% commission. This will be 
reflected in the Gross/Nett rates listed throughout this document.  
Payment terms: 
The G’day Group offer all trade partners credit terms, subject to the completion of a credit agreement when establishing 
an account with us.  
• 
All accommodation bookings will be issued an invoice upon a guest departure or in the event that the booking 
cancels and fees are incurred, with 30-day payment terms.  
• 
Day tour bookings (without accompanying accommodation), will be invoiced monthly, with the same 30-day 
payment terms.    
•

o 
trade@discoveryparks.com.au for bookings at all other Properties 
Our Trade partners will be invoiced for all components which are added to the booking, prior to the guest arriving. 
Example: If you request accommodation, transfers, activities or meals prior to the guest arrival, these will be invoiced to 
you upon guest checkout. Should the guest contact us directly to add touring or additional requests to their booking (Prior 
to their arrival), they will be directed to arrange these with their booking agent.
